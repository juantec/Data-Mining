"Character,",Dialogos
"JAKE,","They can fix a spinal, if you?ve got
the money. But not on vet benefits,
not in this economy."
"PERKY,","The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
century, is making a comeback. These
cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are"
"JAKE,","I became a Marine for the hardship.
To be hammered on the anvil of life.
I told myself I could pass any test
a man can pass."
"JAKE,",If it ain?t rainin? we ain?t trainin
"AGENT 1,",Are you Jake Sully?
"JAKE,","Step off. You?re ruinin? my good
mood."
"AGENT 2,",It?s about your brother.
"JAKE,","The strong prey on the weak. A guy
with a knife took all Tommy would
ever be, for the paper in his
wallet."
"AGENT 1,","Your brother represented a
significant investment. We?d like to
talk to you about taking over his
contract."
"JAKE ,","The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy
was the scientist, not me. He was
the one who wanted to get shot light
years out into space to find the
answers."
"MED TECH,","We?re there, Sunshine."
"MED TECH,","People, you have been in cryo for
five years, nine months and twenty
two days. You will be hungry, you
will be weak. If you feel nausea,
please use the sacks provided for
your convenience. The staff thanks
you in advance."
"CREW CHIEF,","Remember people, you lose your mask
you?re unconscious in 20 seconds and
you?re dead in four minutes. Let?s
nobody be dead today, it looks bad
on my report."
"WAINFLEET,",Look at all that new meat.
"FIKE,","Check it out, man. Meals on wheels."
"WAINFLEET,",That is just wrong.
"JAKE,","What?re you two limpdicks starin?
at?"
"WAINFLEET,","Seen a lotta guys leave this place
in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody
show up in one."
"QUARITCH,","You are on Pandora, ladies and
gentlemen. Respect that fact every
second of every day."
"JAKE,","Nothing like an old-school safety
brief to put your mind at ease."
"NORM,","Hey, you?re Jake right? Tom?s
brother? You look just like him.
(off Jake?s wary look)
Sorry, I?m Norm Spellman, I went
through avatar training with him."
"JAKE,",Yeah.
"NORM,","And duh! -- obviously you look like
him. I mean, if you weren?t
genetically identical, you wouldn?t
be taking over his avatar."
"JAKE,",That?s why I?m here.
"NORM,","So,you want to go check it out?"
"MAX,","Me and Norm were out here to drive
these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars. They?re grown from
human DNA mixed with DNA from the
natives here."
"JAKE,",Damn. They got big.
"NORM,","Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
(to Max)
So the proprioceptive sims worked
pretty well."
"MAX,","Yeah, they?ve got great muscle tone.
Give us a few hours, you guys can
take them for a spin."
"JAKE,",It looks like him.
"NORM,","No, it looks like you. This is your
avatar now, Jake.
ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank."
"JAKE,","The idea is every driver is
matched to his own avatar "
"NORM,","Yeah. You just need to get in the
habit of documenting everything --
what you see, what you feel -- it?s
all part of the science. Good
science starts with good
observation."
"JAKE,","Right.
(to camera)
So, whatever. Here I am. Doing
science.
(looks around)
Never been in a lab before."
"MAX,","Log off. It?s time to meet your boss
for the next five years."
"NORM,","Grace Augustine is a legend. She's
the head of the Avatar Program, and
she wrote the book -- I mean
literally wrote the book -- on
Pandoran botany."
"MAX,","(low, over his shoulder)
That's because she likes plants
better than people."
"GRACE,",Who?s got my goddamn cigarette?!
"MAX,","And here she is, Cinderella back
from the ball. Grace, I?d like you
to meet Norm Spellman"
"GRACE,","Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?"
"NORM,","May the All Mother smile upon our
first meeting."
"GRACE,",Not bad. You sound a little formal.
"NORM,","There is still much to learn.
Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Na?vi.,"
"MAX,","Uh, Grace, this is Jake"
"GRACE,","Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and
I don?t need you. I need your
brother."
"JAKE,","He?s dead. I know it?s a big
inconvenience to everyone."
"GRACE,","How much lab training have you had?
Ever run a gas chromatograph?"
"JAKE,",No.
"GRACE,",Any actual lab work at all?
"JAKE,","High school chemistry. But I
ditched."
"GRACE,","You see? You see? They?re pissing on
us without even the courtesy of
calling it rain."
"MAX,","Grace, that?s not a good idea."
"GRACE,","Parker, I used to think it was
benign neglect, but now I see you?re
intentionally screwing us."
"SELFRIDGE,","Grace. You know I enjoy our little
talks."
"GRACE,","I need a research assistant, not
some jarhead dropout."
"SELFRIDGE,","Actually, we got lucky with him."
"GRACE,",Lucky? How is this in any way lucky?
"SELFRIDGE,","Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
brother, and lucky the brother
wasn?t an oral hygienist or
something. A Marine we can use. I?m
assigning him to your team as
security escort."
"GRACE,","The last thing I need is another
trigger happy asshole out there!"
"SELFRIDGE,","Look, you?re supposed to be winning
the hearts and minds of the natives.
Isn?t that the whole point of your
little puppet show? If you look like
them, if you talk like them, they?ll
trust you?"
"GRACE,","That tends to happen when you use
machine guns on them."
"SELFRIDGE,","This is why we?re here. Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells
for twenty million a kilo. No other
reason. This is what pays for the
party. And it?s what pays for your
science. Comprendo?"
"GRACE,",How much link time have you logged?
"NORM,",Five hundred and twenty hours.
"JAKE,",Like -- an hour.
"GRACE,",Tell me you?re joking.
"JAKE,",Don?t! I got this.
"GRACE,","So you just figured you?d come out
here to the most hostile environment
known to man, with no training of
any kind, and see how it went? What
was going through your head?"
"JAKE,","Maybe I was just tired of doctors
telling me what I couldn?t do."
"GRACE,","Relax and let your mind go blank.
That shouldn?t be hard for you"
"JAKE,","Kiss the darkest part of my lily
white"
"MAX,","That?s a gorgeous brain. Nice
activity."
"GRACE,","Go figure.
(walking away)
Alright, I?m going in."
"TECH,","Phase-lock at forty percent. He?s in
transition."
"MAX,",That?s it. Find your way home.
"TECH,","Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The
link is stable."
"MAX,",That?s it. Find your way home.
"TECH,","Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The
link is stable."
"MAX,","Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
your motor control. Try touching
your fingertips together "
"MED TECH,","Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down"
"MAX,","Jake! Wait, we have to run some
tests"
"GRACE ,",Hey Marine!
"JAKE,",Grace?
"GRACE,","Well who?d you expect, numbnuts?
Think fast!"
"NORM,","Hey, check it out."
"QUARITCH,","For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
small one. See, they like it when I
bring fresh meat out here. And this
clearcutting really stirs up the
hornet?s nest. So keep your head on
a swivel. If it moves, shoot it. If
you?re not sure it?s moving"
"TROOPERS,","Shoot it, sir!"
"QUARITCH,",Outstanding. Let?s roll.
"JAKE,",That?s kinda freaky.
"GRACE,","Lights out amigos. See ya? at
dinner."
"GRACE,",Damn. Same old sack a? bones.
"TRUDY,","Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in
the Armor Bay."
"JAKE,","You guys?re packing some heavy
ordinance."
"TRUDY,","Yeah, ?cause we?re not the only
thing flyin? around out there. Or
the biggest. I?m gonna need you on a
door gun, I?m a man short."
"JAKE,","Yeah, no problem."
"TRUDY,","See ya on the flight-line, zero
nine."
"QUARITCH,","This low gravity makes you soft.
(pushing the last rep)
You get soft, Pandora will shit you
out dead with zero warning."
"JAKE,",I figured -- just another hellhole.
"MECHANIC,","That servo?s in, Colonel, if you
want to try it."
"QUARITCH,","I was in First Recon a few years
ahead of you. More than a few. Two
tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I
come out here and --
He points to his scarred face."
"QUARITCH,","The avatar program is a joke --
buncha limpdick scientists. But we
have a unique opportunity here, you
and I. A recon Marine in an avatar
body could get me the intel I need,
on the ground, right in the
hostiles? camp."
"JAKE,","That sounds real good, Colonel. So -
- am I still with Augustine?"
"QUARITCH,","On paper. You walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,
but you report to me. Can you do
that for me?"
"QUARITCH,","Look, son -- I take care of my own.
Get me what I need, I?ll see you get
your legs back when you rotate home.
Your real legs."
"GRACE,","Start calibrating. We?re on the
flight line in ten minutes."
"JAKE,",Just Marines comparin? tattoos.
"GRACE,","She stops, turning to drill him with a look."
"JAKE,",Got it.
"GRACE,","That son of a bitch has screwed up
this program enough. All this --
28.
(indicating link room)
-- exists so we can go out there and
build a bridge of trust to these
people, who could teach us so much.
But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs
the Na?vi won?t even talk to us
anymore."
"JAKE,",Then how?s this supposed to work?
"GRACE,","We have a new face.
(turning to Norm)
You?re fluent, you?ve studied the
culture. You?re non-threatening. The
ones we know best -- the Omaticaya
clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe
you can get them back to the table
before things go tits-up for good."
"NORM,",This is failing as a pep talk.
"JAKE,",How do we contact them?
"GRACE,","We don?t. They contact us. If they
see us taking our samples, treating
the forest with respect --
(pointedly to Jake)
Not trampling everything in sight --
they may reach out to us."
"JAKE,",Or they may skin us and make a drum.
"GRACE,","Just keep your mouth shut and let
Norm do the talking"
"TRUDY,","Sturmbeest herd, one o?clock.
Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see--
A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river."
"GRACE,","Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles."
"NORM,","The bull has the red on the dorsal
armor?"
"WAINFLEET,",Yo Chacon! Get some!
"GRACE,","Stay with the ship.
(for Jake)
One idiot with a gun?s enough."
"WAINFLEET,","Whatever you say, Doc."
"GRACE,","Relax, Marine. You?re making me
nervous."
"NORM,",How will they know we?re here?
"GRACE,","I?m sure they?re watching us right
now."
"NORM,",Why don?t they come back?
"GRACE,","The Na?vi learned as much about us
as they needed to know."
"JAKE,",What happened here?
"GRACE,","Are you going to help with this
gear? We?ve got a lot to do."
"JAKE,",It?s already pissed off!
"GRACE,","Jake, that armor?s too thick. Trust
me."
"JAKE,",What do I do?
"GRACE,",Hold your ground!
"JAKE,",Oh yeah! Who?s bad?! That?s right.
"GRACE,",Run. Definitely RUN!
"TRUDY,","I?m going to have to call it, guys.
We?re not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel?s orders."
"GRACE,","He?s not going to make it till
morning."
"JAKE,","I don?t have all goddamn night! Come
on! Come on!"
"NEYTIRI,",Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!
"JAKE,","Look, um, I know you probably don?t
understand this. But -- thanks.
Thank you. I owe you."
"NEYTIRI,","Forgive me. May your spirit run with
the Great Mother."
"JAKE,","I would have been screwed if you
hadn?t come along"
"NEYTIRI,","Don?t thank! You don?t thank for
this! This is sad. Very sad, only."
"JAKE,","Okay, I?m sorry. Whatever I did --
I?m sorry."
"NEYTIRI,","All this is your fault! They did not
need to die."
"JAKE,","They attacked me. How?m I the bad
guy here"
"NEYTIRI,","Your fault! You are like a baby,
making noise, don?t know what to do.
You should not come here, all of
you! You only come and make
problems. Only."
"JAKE,","Okay, fine, you love your little
forest friends. So why not just let
them kill my ass? What?s the
thinking?"
"NEYTIRI,",Why save you?
"JAKE,","Yes, why save me?"
"NEYTIRI,",You have a strong heart. No fear.
"JAKE,","If I?m so ignorant, maybe you should
teach me."
"NEYTIRI,","Sky people can not learn. You do not
See."
"JAKE,","Whooaa.
He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace."
"NEYTIRI,","No one can teach you to See.
Then she turns and trots on."
"JAKE,","Hey, slow down. Look, I think we
just got off on the wrong foot and -
-
Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height."
"JAKE,","you just have to get to know me.
I?m Jake. Jake Sull"
"NEYTIRI,",You should not be here.
"JAKE,",So take me with you.
"NEYTIRI,",No. You go back.
"JAKE,","What?
More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him."
"NEYTIRI,","Atokirina?. Seeds of the Great Tree
-- very pure spirits."
"JAKE,",What was that all about?
"NEYTIRI,","Tsu?tey, what are you doing?! He is
my captive!"
"EYTUKAN,","Why do you bring this creature here?
Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na?vi."
"NEYTIRI,","I was going to kill him, but there
was a sign from Eywa."
"EYTUKAN,","I have said no dreamwalker will come
here, to offend our home! His alien
smell fills my nose"
"NEYTIRI,","Father, many atokirina came to this
alien."
"JAKE,",What?s going on?
"NEYTIRI,","My father is deciding whether to
kill you."
"JAKE,","Your father!?
(to Eytukan)
Uh, good to meet you, sir."
"MO?AT,","Step back!
Everybody looks up."
"NEYTIRI,","That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the
one who interprets the will of Eywa."
"JAKE,",Who?s Eywa?
"MO?AT,",What are you called?
"JAKE,",Jake Sully.
"MO'AT,",Why did you come to us?
"JAKE,",I came to learn.
"MO'AT,","We have tried to teach other Sky
People. It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full."
"JAKE,","My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
Doctor Augustine. I?m no scientist"
"MO'AT,",What are you?
"JAKE,","I don?t know. I was a Marine -- uh,
a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan."
"TSU?TEY,",A warrior! I could kill him easily!
"EYTUKAN,","No! This is the first warrior
dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
learn more about him."
"JAKE,","What?s going on? What are they
saying?"
"MO?AT,","Daughter. You will teach him our
way, to speak and walk as we do."
"NEYTIRI,",Why me? That's not fair! I only
"MO?AT,",It is decided!
"JAKE,","So it?s all good, right? You and me"
"NEYTIRI,",Do not speak.
"JAKE,",Don?t get up.
"NEYTIRI,",Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at?ite.
"JAKE,","Okay, again, a whole lot slower."
"NEYTIRI,","Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
Jake knows she?s baiting him. He smiles in response."
"JAKE,",Nay-TEE-ree. That?s nice. Nay-TEEree.
"TSU?TEY,","These aliens try to look like
people, but they can?t."
"MO'AT,","He seems dim to me. And his eyes are
too small."
"JAKE,",Your mom likes me. I can tell.
"MO'AT,","Neytiri will test this ?warrior.?
Hey may learn nothing -- but we will
learn much."
"EYTUKAN,","You speak truth. We must understand
these Sky People if we are to drive
them out."
"JAKE,",These rock. What are they?
"NEYTIRI,",Teylu. You call beetle larvae.
"JAKE,","That?s some damn fine teylu. That?s
like grandma?s teylu."
"TSU?TEY,",I say she will kill him.
"GRACE,","Come on back, kid, that?s it."
"JAKE,","Wha --? Oh.
He looks around, blinking. Reality crashing in."
"GRACE,","Damn, you were dug in like a tick.
(she helps him sit up)
Is the avatar safe?"
"JAKE,","Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going
to believe where I am."
"GRACE,","so the kid?s out there one night
and he?s got the Queen Bitch herself
offering him the spare room and the
car keys. Unbelievable."
"JAKE,",It?s not something you can teach.
"MAX,","That?s awesome, Jake."
"GRACE,","For reasons I cannot fathom, the
Omaticaya have chosen you. God help
us all."
"QUARITCH,","Jarhead clan?
(he laughs)
And that worked?"
"JAKE,","Yeah. They want to study me. See if
I can learn to be one of them."
"QUARITCH,","That?s how you seize the initiative.
I wish I had ten more like you."
"SELFRIDGE,","Look, Sully -- find out what these
blue monkeys want."
"JAKE,",Does Augustine know about this?
"SELFRIDGE,","Yeah, she does, and she?s on the
next ship back if she tries to cockblock me on it."
"JAKE,",So -- who talks them into moving?
"SELFRIDGE,","Killing the indigenous looks bad,
but there?s one thing shareholders
hate more than bad press -- and
that?s a bad quarterly statement.
Find me a carrot to get them to
move, or it?s going to have to be
all stick."
"QUARITCH,","You got three months. That?s when
the dozers get there."
"JAKE,",Tsu?tey.
"GRACE,","He?s the clan leader --
(indicating Mo?at)
-- but she?s the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman."
"JAKE,",Got it. So who?s this Eywa?
"NORM,","Who?s Eywa? Oh, only their deity.
The Great Mother. The goddess made
up of all living things. You?d know
that if you had any training
whatsoever."
"JAKE,","Who?s got a date with the chief?s
daughter?"
"GRACE,","Knock it off. Jesus, it?s like
kindergarten around here."
"GRACE,","Neytiri was my best student. She and
her sister Silwanin. Just amazing
girls."
"JAKE,",I didn?t meet the sister.
"GRACE,","No, she?s dead."
"MAX,",Link is ready.
"GRACE,",Don?t do anything unusually stupid.
"NEYTIRI,","This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel
her heartbeat, her breath. Feel her
strong legs."
"NEYTIRI,","You may tell her what to do --
(she touches her head)
-- inside. For now, say where to go."
"JAKE,","The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
lands painfully in the mud."
"NEYTIRI,",Again.
"JAKE,","You?ve got outer columns, then a
secondary ring here, and an inner
ring. Then a core structure, it?s
like a spiral, that?s how they move
up and down."
"QUARITCH,","I?m going to need accurate scans of
all these columns."
"JAKE,",Roger that.
"GRACE,","I?m not about to let Quaritch and
Selfridge micro-manage this thing.
(she looks pointedly at
Jake)
We?re going up into the mountains."
"GRACE,","There?s a mobile link up at Site 26
that we can work out of."
"NORM,",The Hallelujah Mountains?
"GRACE,",That?s right.
"NORM,","Yesssss!
(off Jake?s look)
The legendary Floating Mountains of
Pandora? Heard of them?"
"TRUDY,","It only takes tiny inputs. Here, put
your hand on the cyclic "
"TRUDY,","Feel how small the moves are? You
barely have to think it, and the
aircraft reacts."
"GRACE,","See these magnetic formations. We?re
getting close."
"TRUDY,",Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.
"GRACE,",Yup. We?re in the flux vortex.
"TRUDY,",You should see your face.
"JAKE,","Yeah, so what does hold them up?
Grace explained it to me -- some
kind of maglev effect because
unobtanium is a superconductor, or
something. At least somebody
understands it. Just not me."
"GRACE,","Jake, take number two, it?s the
least glitchy. Norm, I need you to
operate Jake?s link."
"JAKE,",Hey. You got a problem?
"NORM,","I trained three years for this
mission. I speak the language
fluently."
"GRACE,","It?s not our choice, Norm."
"NORM,","Yeah, well I didn?t come out here to
wash the dishes while you?re on some
interspecies booty call."
"GRACE,",He can?t go far.
"GRACE,",Let?s get you in.
"JAKE,",Holy shit.
"NEYTIRI,",Do not look in her eye.
"NEYTIRI,","Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one
Hunter in the whole life."
"JAKE,","Do I have to do this? I need some
rack."
"GRACE,"," now, when it?s fresh."
"JAKE,","Yeah, yeah.
(to camera)
The days are starting to blur
together. The language is a bitch,
but I figure it?s like fieldstripping a weapon. Repetition."
"NORM,",Thank you?
"JAKE,","It?s good he?s back on board, but he
thinks I?m a retard too."
"GRACE,","I See you, Neytiri Mo?at?ite."
"NEYTIRI,","I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine."
"JAKE,","I?m learning to read the trails, the
tracks at the water-hole, the
tiniest scents and sounds."
"NEYTIRI,","When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing,
you will See everything."
"JAKE ,","Sometimes I have no idea what she?s
talking about."
"JAKE,","It?s been a month and I?m still not
allowed to make a kill. She says the
forest hasn?t given permission."
"GRACE,","This isn?t just about eye-hand
coordination out there. You need to
listen to what she says. Try to see
the forest through their eyes."
"JAKE ,","I See you Brother, and thank you.
Your spirit goes with Eywa, your
body stays behind to become part of
the People."
"NEYTIRI,",A clean kill. You are ready.
"GRACE,",You?re still losing weight. Here
"JAKE,","I made a kill today. We ate it. I
know where that meal came from."
"GRACE,","Other body. You need to take care of
this body."
"GRACE,","Jake, I?m serious -- you look like
crap. You?re burning too hard."
"JAKE,","Get rid of this shit, then you can
lecture me."
"GRACE,","I?m telling you, as your boss and
someone who might even consider"
"GRACE,","A scientist stays objective -- we
can not be ruled by emotion. But I
poured ten years of my life into
that school. They called me
sa’atenuk. Mother."
"NEYTIRI,","Now you choose your ikran. This you
must feel -- inside. If he also
chooses you, move quick, like I
showed. You will have one chance."
"JAKE,","THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as
they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and "
"TRUDY,","There usually isn’t time to key the
mike."
"TRUDY,","I saw one take out a gunship once --
WHAM! Total frickin’ yard sale. Ate
the crew like peanuts."
"GRACE,","Something big is going on in there,
biologically. I’d die to get
samples, but outsiders are strictly
forbidden."
"TRUDY,","If you don’t give him something,
he’s gonna shut us down."
"NEYTIRI,","My grandfather’s grandfather was
Toruk Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow.
Toruk chose him. It has only
happened five times since the time
of the First Songs."
"NEYTIRI,","Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought
the clans together in a time of
great sorrow. All Na’vi people know
this story."
"GRACE,","Watch that stuff. It’ll knock you
into next week."
"SELFRIDGE,","Good of you to stop by. How’s it
going out there? Our blue friends
all packed up yet?"
"GRACE,","Jake is making incredible progress,
years worth in just a few months.
But -- we need more time."
"SELFRIDGE,",Not what I was hoping to hear.
"GRACE,","Parker, it’s their ancestral home.
They’ve lived there since before
human history began. You can spare
them a few more weeks."
"SELFRIDGE,","This thing is inevitable. What does
it matter when it happens? I’m
sorry, Dr. Augustine. You’re out of
time."
"QUARITCH,","You’re not gettin’ lost in the
woods, are you son?"
"QUARITCH,","Your last report was two weeks ago.
I’m starting to doubt your resolve.
From what I see, it’s time to
terminate this mission. Look, you’ve given me plenty of
usable intel. Like this “Well of
Souls” place -- I’ve got them by the
balls with that, when it turns into
a shit-fight. Which it will."
"JAKE,","I’ve gotta finish this thing.
There’s one more test -- the Dream
Hunt. It’s the final stage of
becoming a man. Then I’m one of
them. They’ll trust what I say."
"GRACE,","Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
Na’vi themselves die in these vision
quests. The venom takes you to the
edge of death."
"NORM,",Calibrating. Thirty seconds.
"GRACE,","Our life out there takes millions of
dollars of machinery to sustain. You
visit -- and you leave."
"JAKE,","That’s right -- to embed with the
Omaticaya. To find out how to screw
them out of their home. By deceit or
by force, he didn’t care. And if it
turned out to be force, then how
best to do it."
"JAKE,","I’m not that guy any more. But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
yanks me out -- I never see her
